Yes, we need your support, too! As a small startup with hardly any advertizing budget we have to rely on our customers and their word-of-mouth.

This is why we ask for your support. So if you like our soups and the idea, and our service could convince you go into the streets and shout it out as loud as you can, then do it!! Or just use one of the following tools which make it a bit easier.
 

You could...

...become a souplove fan on facebook

Well, we guess one cannot get around fb nowadays. It's really nice to browse other souplove friends and see what they do. This is why we started a souplove fanpage on facebook recently. Check it out!

 

...tell a friend about souplove

Tell your friends and colleagues about us. Take your soups for a walk and to office. Let everyone have a spoon of it. Greedy people just let them taste by e-mail.



...write a review about souplove

Everyword counts now a days, and your reviews will reassure other customers, let them know just how our soup is, suggest mixes and help them find us easier!! The more customers we have the more we can invest and and the more new soup ideas we can develop!

 
...link souplove

You‘ve got a website or blog? Every link helps! Maybe one of our banners appeals you? Sex up your sites! It‘s pretty simple to embed it.
