Yes, we need your support, too! As a small startup with hardly any advertizing budget we have to rely on our customers and their word-of-mouth.

This is why we ask for your support. So if you like our soups and the idea, and our service could convince you go into the streets and shout it out as loud as you can, then do it!! Or just use one of the following tools which make it a bit easier.
